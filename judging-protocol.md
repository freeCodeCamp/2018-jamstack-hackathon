# Judging Protocol & Schedule
*Note: This document is tentative. Times are subject to change*

# Rules
If you are competing for prizes, you must:

1. Use the JAMstack. You must not build a monolithic app or run a web server.
2. Max team size: 6 (Recommended team size: 3-5)
3. Abide by our code of conduct
4. To win API prizes, you must use their API. You can review them in [apis.md](./apismd)

# Judging Criteria
<!-- Your project will be judged on:

1. Project intrigue/novelty
2. Product Design & Functionality
3. Presentation/Pitch

## Not competing for prizes?
Build whatever you'd like, of course. -->


## Qualifying Pitches
**3:00 - 5:00pm, Main Stage**  
You should be present by the main stage at least 5 minutes before your presentation is scheduled to start.  
This time may be adjusted depending on the number of hackers and teams present.  

* 1 minute, **hard stop**
* 40 seconds Q + A
<!-- * Judges will have a master laptop for you -->
* We recommend practicing your pitch. Cut out any fluff. Format:
  * Attention-grabbing headliner
  * What the problem is that you're solving
  * Why your product is the solution
  * Demo of your product
  * Remember - you have 1 minute! We will stop you at 60 seconds exactly.
* Arrive to stand in line at least 5 minutes before your scheduled start time. If you are not at the GitHub stage at your designated time, you will be disqualified.
* Ensure that your demo is ready & working; you will not get another chance.
* Got presentation slides but no demo? Sure, that's ok. But it's very likely that only working prototypes will advance you to the next round.

Review your team's place in the queue for presentations here: **Posted at 2:00pm Sunday in the Discord**

We are using the US Navy Observatory Master Clock for time. If you're on a Mac, you should be synced to this, but it's worth verifying to make sure:

#### The top 6 teams will move on to present on a judging panel, where we will discuss your project on video for around 10 minutes.

Note that the top 6 teams are contending for the *overall* hackathon winers. API sponsors may opt to select winners outside of this top 6.

**The top 6 teams will be present and take questions on video, which will be streamed to the televisions throughout the GitHub office. If you do not wish to be on video, you can opt to not join your team in your presentation.**

Winners will be announced in the Discord channel #announcements around 5:00pm.
