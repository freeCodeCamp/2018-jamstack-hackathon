## Qualifying Pitches
**3:00 - 5:00pm, Main Stage**

* 2 minutes, **hard stop**
* 1 minute Q + A
* Bring your laptop or phone to demo
* We recommend practicing your pitch. Cut out any fluff.
* Arrive to stand in line at least 5 minutes before your scheduled start time.
* Ensure that your demo is ready & working; you will not get another chance.
* Got slides? Sure, that's ok. But likely only working prototypes will advance you to the next round


Review where you are on the schedule here: **Posted at 2:00pm**

We are using the US Navy Observatory Master Clock for time. If you're on a Mac, you should be synced to this, but it's worth verifying to make sure:

**If you are not present for your scheduled presentation, you will be disqualified from overall prizes/presentations.**

#### The top 6 teams will move on to present on a judging panel, where we will discuss your project on video for around 10 minutes.

Note that the top 6 teams are contending for the *overall* hackathon winers. API sponsors may opt to select winners outside of this top 6.

**The top 6 teams will be present and take questions on video, which will be streamed to the televisions throughout the GitHub office. If you do not wish to be on video, you can opt to not join your team in your presentation.**

## Top 6 Teams Panel

Winners will be announced in the Slack channel #announcements around 5:00pm.
