* Meet with the API sponsors at the hackathon, particularly on Saturday morning
* Communicate with the API sponsors via their dedicated Discord channel.



# Netlify
Netlify automates deployment for your frontend, serving your apps and sites over our custom global Content Delivery Network. You won't need server-side rendering with our integrated [prerendering](https://www.netlify.com/docs/prerendering), [proxy redirects](https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects), [form handling](https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling), [user authentication](https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity), [serverless Lambda functions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions), and more.

### Purpose
Developers everywhere are using the [JAMstack](https://jamstackconf.com/what-is-jamstack) approach to connect blazing fast frontends to a growing array of microservice APIs. There are lots of advantages to this, but sometimes you need to run a bit of server-side code. It's not worth running a whole server for, and that approach doesn't scale well, anyway. Serverless functions services like AWS Lambda are perfect for this, and Netlify's [new functions add-on](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2018/03/20/netlifys-aws-lambda-functions-bring-the-backend-to-your-frontend-workflow/) makes it easy to deploy, test, and access your Lambda functions right alongside the rest of your app.

### Challenges
<!-- We are looking for the most interesting app using Netlify's integrated Lambda [functions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions).

To be eligible for the prize, your app must be deployed to Netlify, and use at least one Lambda function. -->

# Hasura
#### Quick Description
<!-- Hasura provides instant backend APIs for your frontend, a simple `git push` to deploy your app and GraphQL APIs on PostgreSQL without any set up. -->


### Purpose
<!-- Almost every dynamic Web or Mobile App requires an API to talk to the Database, Authentication for User Identity, some form of File Management and an easy way to deploy.

Hasura makes your development fast with
* Instant Backend APIs for Database (GraphQL / HTTP JSON over PostgreSQL)
* Authentication APIs for multiple providers with a ready to use UI Kit.
* Filestore APIs to manage file uploads and retreival.

Imagine all of these APIs with permissions / access control defined by you for your application. And just doing a `git push hasura master` to deploy your app.

Hasura has quickstart projects so that you don't have to setup the initial project structure / boilerplate code. Head over to [Hasura Hub](https://hasura.io/hub) for cloning a boilerplate of your choice. For example - [hello-react](https://hasura.io/hub/projects/hasura/hello-react). This will be a ready to deploy project which will give you a hasura-app.io domain for your project, HTTPS enabled, HTTP/2 - gzip supported API Gateway so that its production ready. -->
