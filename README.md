## How is this hackathon different?

Most hackathons focus principally on the end-goal -- the product. While this hackathon places a significant amount of focus on the end-product as well, we are also placing a significant amount of focus in the *process* of how you approach building your project.

### The Process -- what it means

Building great software isn't just about the code you write. Your planned approach to building it just as important. So here's what this means for you as a hacker at this hackathon:
* Judges may pose a number of questions for you, and share them with you in the Discord group
* Judges may visit teams and ask you these questions to see how you are handling your approach to building your app. Do you have a plan of action? Are you organized in your list of responsibilities and dividing tasks? Are the goals realistic given the limited time frame?
* These ad-hoc interviews will take place shortly after lunch on Saturday. We will livestream them.
* Your answers to these questions will be a small percentage of your overall judging score.

## Purpose
The Hackathon is designed to be a fun and educational environment. Of course there will also be competition for prizes -- but our main goal is education, building community, and learning to use some cool APIs and technologies!

## Perks

Thanks to the generosity of GitHub, you will have coffee, breakfast, lunch, and light dinner on both days! üëè*applause for GitHub*üëè  

Send them a thank you note for being the most amazing hosts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/github)!

Once hacking ends on Sunday, we'll celebrate with some beer, wine, cocktails and mockatails, and watch the top 6 teams get interviewed. The interviews will be broadcast on the many monitors at GitHub's office. Then we'll reconvene to see the top 3 teams present on stage!
