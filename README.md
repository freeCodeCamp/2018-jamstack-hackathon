## How is this hackathon different?

Most hackathons focus principally on the end-goal -- the product. While this hackathon places a significant amount of focus on the end-product as well, we are also placing a significant amount of focus in the *process* of how you approach building your project.

### The Process -- what it means

Building great software isn't just about the code you write. Your planned approach to building it that is equally if not more important. So here's what this means for you as a hacker at this hackathon:
* Judges will pose a number of questions for you, and share them with you in the Discord group
* Judges will visit teams and ask you these questions to see how you are handling your approach to building your app. Do you have a plan of action? Are you organized in your list of responsibilities and dividing tasks? Are the goals realistic given the limited time frame?
* These ad-hoc interviews will take place shortly after lunch on Saturday. We will livestream the
* Your answers to these questions will be a small percentage of your overall judging score.
