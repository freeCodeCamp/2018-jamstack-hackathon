# Fit My Feet
### Finding the right shoe size for your feet can be annoying. Not anymore!

    - Zubair Ahmed (@Zubair)
    - Alexandra Waite (@alexw)
* Seeking Teammates: No
* [Project URL](https://github.com/zubairnahmed/fit-my-feet)
* Fit My Feet

### Project Q&A:
1. What are you going to build?  
   We are building an e-commerce site that sells shoes. We use AI to find the best fit for your feet.
2. Which APIs do you plan to use? 
   We plan to use Clarifai, Pilon, and Formspree.
3. What is your plan to execute this idea?  
   First, we will research the APIs and learn how to integrate with them. Then, we'll create a React application and split up    tasks between the two of us. One person will tackle training a Clarifai model with shoe and feet images, as well as 
   integrating with it. The other person will get one or two shoes integrated as products with Pilon. Once done with Pilon and
   Clarifai integrations, we will together add the contact form for Formspree. Ready to have some fun!
